Option 1: Digital Art & NFT Project Collaboration Hub
💡 Core Concept

A workflow-based SaaS for managing NFT art creation — where client → manager → artist pipelines mimic a creative agency structure.
No blockchain gimmicks, just structured collaboration with optional NFT minting.

🧱 Roles & Responsibilities
Role	Responsibilities
Admin	Onboards clients, creates managers, final review before closure.
Manager	Gathers requirements, assigns members, reviews uploaded art.
Member (Artist)	Uploads digital art files, follows feedback loop.
Client	Provides requirements, gives final approval or change requests.
🔁 Workflow

Client onboarding → Admin creates client & assigns Manager.

Requirement phase → Manager collects requirements (e.g., “10 NFTs in cyberpunk theme”).

Task creation → Manager creates tasks per NFT, assigns artists.

Art submission → Artists upload files (JPG, PNG, PSD).

Manager review → Approve / Reject / Hold with comments.

Admin verification → Confirms project meets requirements.

Client review → Client views all completed arts and gives feedback.

Revision loop → If required → back to manager → assigned again.

Closure → Once approved → Project marked complete.

🧩 Tech Stack (light but scalable)

Frontend: React + Tailwind + Zustand/Redux

Backend: Node.js (Express / NestJS)

DB: MongoDB (great for versioned documents & project data)

Storage: AWS S3 (or Cloudinary for easy file mgmt)

Auth: JWT + Role-based middleware

Deployment: Render / Vercel (frontend) + Railway / Render (backend)

🌈 Why It’s Smart to Build

Easy to demo solo (you can simulate all roles).

Useful for digital agencies or NFT studios.

Heavy workflow focus = great for interviews and portfolios.

Can evolve into a creative project management SaaS (if you expand later).
